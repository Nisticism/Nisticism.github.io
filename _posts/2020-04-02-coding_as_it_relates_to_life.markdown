I believe that there are some similarities to be recognized when it comes to comparing coding to the rest of life in general.  It's true that while coding, a person is often stationary and focused on the content of the code and not the action of coding.  This is somewhat similar to the need to contemplate life and think about the bigger picture, because in such actions one is focused only on conceptual thought.

Coding also takes a certain degree of spacial reasoning.  You might not think about it like that if you're constantly writing procedural code, but in object oriented programming you're moving around a bunch of virtual things and connecting them to other objects, and you have to keep track of exactly how that's done. 

The most striking similarity to me, is that the seasoned coder is thinking constantly about how to make things happen with as little code as possible, just as the most elegant moves in life are often the most meaningful.  Einstein can be quoted in saying "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler".  Basically it's good to keep in mind throughout your entire life, how easy things can be made, just as with coding it's good to keep in the shortest and most efficient path.
